# Noir

Noir is a (very WIP) murder mystery roguelite where players can act as detectives solving procedurally generated crimes. This is mostly a personal project that allows me to learn more about Rust and WASM/web development and to demonstrate my skills in these areas.

Right now, the "game" is just a start menu and a white '@' that you can control using the arrow keys. You can try it out in the browser [here](https://mihirlaud.github.io/noir/). Have fun!

## To-do
